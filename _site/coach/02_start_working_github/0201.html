<h1 id="task-01---set-up-a-github-repository">Task 01 - Set up a GitHub repository</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Some learners create their first repository via GitHub Desktop.  Make sure learners understand how a distributed source control such as Git differs from a centralized source control system such as Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) or Subversion (SVN).</li>
  <li>To clone a repository via command line, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone $URL</code> in the directory into which you wish to copy the repository. In order to get the value for URL, perform the following steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to your repository in GitHub.</li>
      <li>Select the green button labeled “&lt;&gt; Code”.</li>
      <li>In the Clone section of the Local tab, select the copy button to get the URL.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the training files into the root of this new directory.</li>
  <li>In the command line, the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add --all</code> will mark for tracking all of the files you just copied to the folder.</li>
  <li>In order to commit changes, type in a command such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -am "My first commit"</code>. Note that the commit message can be whatever you wish it to be.</li>
  <li>The final step is to push this code to the remote GitHub repository. To do this, execute the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push -u</code>. If this is the first time you are pushing to a particular GitHub repository, you might see a warning message.</li>
</ul>
