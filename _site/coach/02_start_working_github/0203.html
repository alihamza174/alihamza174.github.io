<ul>
  <li>The solution for this task is a YAML file in <a href="../Solution/Exercise-02/Task-3/first-workflow.yml">the solutions folder</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each GitHub Actions workflow has a certain structure to it, following the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions">GitHub Actions workflow syntax</a>. The following is an annotated breakdown of this structure.</p>
