<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Agile project management is a key component of building a modern DevOps culture at your organization. If you are new to Agile or just want a refresher, we recommend you review the following articles:</p>

</ol>

<p>To help you with Agile project management, we have <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">GitHub project boards</a>. With GitHub project boards, you can quickly and easily start tracking your backlog, as well as tasks, issues, bugs, and features associated with your project.</p>

<p>Review the following introduction to GitHub project boards: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects">GitHub project boards</a>.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>In this task, you will show the Munson’s Pickles and Preserves team how to perform a variety of tasks around project and work tracking.</p>

<p>The key tasks are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add other learners from your team room as contributors to your repository.</li>
  <li>Create a new project using the “Team backlog” template.</li>
  <li>Ensure that this new project is linked with your repository.</li>
  <li>Create five draft issues in total, named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 2</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 3</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 4</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 5</code>. When creating each issue, make sure to assign an owner for each issue to someone from your team room. Then, convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 3</code> from a draft issue to an issue and then select the repository you have created. Look at the difference between a draft and your converted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 3</code> issue.</li>
  <li>Move all of your issues to the “Ready” column and convert each one from a draft to an issue.</li>
  <li>Move <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 1</code> to the “In Progress” column.</li>
  <li>Ask the team member to whom you assigned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Issue 1</code> to close the issue. Review your project board to see if the issue automatically moved to the “Done” column.</li>
  <li>Create a new view to show all of your issues as a table.</li>
  <li>Add a custom field to your issue. The custom field should be called “Complexity” and will be a single select type with the following options: Very Easy, Easy, Hard, and Very Hard.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="success-criteria">Success Criteria</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You have added one or more collaborators to your repo.</li>
  <li>You have a project board using the automation Kanban template. This project board contains five issues. Of those, four are open and a team member closed the fifth.</li>
  <li>New issues appear under the “New” column.</li>
  <li>Closed issues automatically appear under the “Done” column.</li>
  <li>You have a table view in addition to your Backlog Board.</li>
  <li>You have a custom field called Complexity on your issues.</li>
</ul>
