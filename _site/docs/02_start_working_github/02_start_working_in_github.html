<h2 id="lab-scenario">Lab Scenario</h2>

<p>Source control is a “must-have” for development projects today, and in this exercise, we will put together a GitHub repository that we will use for the rest of the training. But GitHub is about more than source control repositories. In this exercise, we will also cover GitHub project boards, which allow for collaboration between team members. We will also create a GitHub Actions workflow, which we can use to deploy code resources to remote destinations.</p>

<p>After you complete this lab, you will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clone an existing GitHub repository for your own use</li>
  <li>Add team members to your GitHub repository</li>
