<h2 id="lab-scenario">Lab Scenario</h2>

<p>Load testing is a critical part of quality control for an application. In this exercise, you will create a load testing strategy based on information you will receive from Munsonâ€™s Pickles and Preserves. Then, you will create a load test using a popular load testing solution: Apache JMeter. After creating a load test plan in JMeter, you will then import it into an Azure Load Test and create a GitHub Actions workflow to execute this Azure Load Test on demand. Finally, you will create two additional types of test in Azure: stress tests and chaos tests.</p>

  <li>Deploy and execute an Apache JMeter load test plan in the Azure Load Test service</li>
  <li>Execute Azure Load Tests as part of GitHub Actions workflows</li>
  <li>Stress test a .NET application running on Azure App Services</li>
  <li>Chaos test a .NET application running on Azure App Services</li>
</ul>
