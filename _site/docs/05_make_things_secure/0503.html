<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>To wrap up the DevOps journey Munsonâ€™s Pickles and Preserves would like to understand what is happening in the deployed environments. It is too late to find out about a problem by the time users are complaining about it. It is also imperative to know about not only the performance of the site, but also the impact positive or negative a feature has had on the users. Please take a moment to review the articles below to gain a better understanding of the importance of monitoring and Application Insights, one of the tools available in Azure to make it easy.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>In this task we will look at some of the telemetry that has already been collected by our running instance from Application Insights, injected into the Azure resources created back in our earlier Infrastructure-as-code challenge.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Review the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.bicep</code> file. Find where the Application Insights node was created and note how the Web App was configured to send its logs there.</li>
  <li>Create a dashboard in the Azure Portal to provide a summary of the status of our site. (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/overview-dashboard#application-dashboard">hint</a>)</li>
  <li>Implement an outside-in availability test for the homepage of your site (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-web-app-availability">hint</a>)</li>
</ol>
